The most important thing for victims of domestic violence is safety. If you are in an abusive situation, we encourage you to develop a safety plan. A safety plan is a comprehensive plan for protecting yourself and your children from domestic violence and/or to help you safely escape from the violence and your abuser. Often, writing out your plan helps you regain security and control of your life.

 

Remember, this plan should be used as a guide and a reminder of ways you and your family can increase your safety.

​

If you are a teenager in an abusive dating relationship or you are the parent of a child or teenager who is exposed to an abusive environment, encourage them to develop a youth safety plan.

 

The safety plan should be hidden in a safe place where the abuser is unlikely to find it. It should also be reviewed and updated on a regular basis if the situation or living environment changes.

 

You can call our 24/7 Hotline at (904) 354-3114 or text (904) 210-3698 and an advocate will help you create a safety plan or you can download your own printable version of an adult and/or youth safety plan.
